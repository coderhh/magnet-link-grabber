# GitHub Pages Setup for Privacy Policy

## Push Status

The code has been committed locally. **Push failed** due to repository permissions:
- You are authenticated as: `YehangHan`
- Repository owner: `coderhh`

### To fix the push, choose one:

1. **If you own the `coderhh` account**: Ensure you're logged in with that account (GitHub CLI, Git credentials, or SSH key).
2. **If this is your fork**: Update the remote to your fork:
   ```powershell
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YehangHan/magnet-link-grabber.git
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **If you're a collaborator**: Check your GitHub token/SSH key has write access.

## Enable GitHub Pages

Once the code is pushed to GitHub:

1. Go to **https://github.com/coderhh/magnet-link-grabber** (or your fork)
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main` / **(root)**
   - Click **Save**

4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your privacy policy will be available at:
   ```
   https://coderhh.github.io/magnet-link-grabber/privacy-policy.html
   ```
   (Replace `coderhh` with your username if using a fork.)
