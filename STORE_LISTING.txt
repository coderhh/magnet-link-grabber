2. PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS
========================================

ACTIVE TAB JUSTIFICATION (1000 characters max):
The extension requires "activeTab" permission to access the content of the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This permission allows the extension to scan the page's HTML content for magnet links. The extension only accesses the tab when the user explicitly activates it by clicking the extension icon, ensuring user control and privacy. No data is collected or transmitted - all processing happens locally in the browser. This permission is essential for the extension's single purpose: extracting magnet links from web pages.

SCRIPTING JUSTIFICATION (1000 characters max):
The "scripting" permission is required to inject the content script (content.js) into web pages when needed. This allows the extension to scan the page's HTML source code for magnet links that may be embedded in the page content, not just in anchor tags. The content script runs only when the user clicks the extension icon, and it communicates with the popup to return the found magnet links. This permission is necessary because some magnet links may be present in the page source as plain text or in non-anchor elements, and the extension needs to find all instances. All processing is done locally - no external scripts or remote code are used.

HOST PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION (1000 characters max):
The extension uses "<all_urls>" in the content_scripts field to allow scanning for magnet links on any website the user visits. This is necessary because magnet links can appear on any website - there is no way to predict which sites users will visit that contain magnet links. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any data. It only scans the page's HTML content locally when the user clicks the extension icon, extracts magnet links, and displays them in the popup. The extension has a single, clear purpose: to extract magnet links from web pages, and this requires the ability to scan any page the user chooses to visit. No data leaves the user's browser, and no external servers are contacted.

REMOTE CODE:
No, I am not using Remote code
